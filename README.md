# Air-Quality-Monitor-Using-Linear-

# Overview
This project aims to develop an air quality monitoring system that uses linear regression to analyze and predict air pollution levels. The system collects real-time environmental data, processes it, and provides insights into air quality trends.

# Features
1. Real-time air quality data collection
2. Data preprocessing and visualization
3. Linear regression model for prediction
4. Graphical representation of air quality trends

# Technologies Used
1. Python
2. Scikit-Learn
3. Pandas & NumPy
4. Matplotlib & Seaborn
5. Sensor Data (if applicable)

# Installation
1. Clone the repository:
          <link>git clone https://github.com/aryanhiremath/Air-Quality-Monitor-Using-Linear-Regression.git</link>
