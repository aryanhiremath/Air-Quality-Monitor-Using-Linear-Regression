# Air Quality Monitor Using Linear Regression

## Overview
This project aims to develop an air quality monitoring system that uses linear regression to analyze and predict air pollution levels. The system collects real-time environmental data, processes it, and provides insights into air quality trends.

## Features
- Real-time air quality data collection
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Linear regression model for prediction
- Graphical representation of air quality trends

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-Learn
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Sensor Data (if applicable)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/aryanhiremath/Air-Quality-Monitor-Using-Linear-Regression.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd Air-Quality-Monitor-Using-Linear-Regression
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the data collection script (if applicable):
   ```sh
   python collect_data.py
   ```
2. Train the linear regression model:
   ```sh
   python train_model.py
   ```
3. Predict air quality using the trained model:
   ```sh
   python predict.py
   ```
4. Visualize the results:
   ```sh
   python visualize.py
   ```

## Dataset
- The dataset used for training can be collected from sensors or sourced from publicly available air quality datasets.
- Ensure proper data cleaning and preprocessing before training the model.
